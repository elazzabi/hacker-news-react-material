See it live at **[surge](https://hnrm.surge.sh/)**

## Using the app locally
This app is developed using create-react-app, but it's not necessary to have it in your own machine.

After clonning the repository, install dependecies by executing:
```
npm install
```
After that, start the local server by executing:
```
npm start
```
The app is now on http://localhost:3000/

## Contribution
I'm open to any type of contribution and thank you in advance :+1:

After the desired contribution, you can run the tests locally by executing:
```
npm run test
```
Jest and Enzyme are used for the tests.
